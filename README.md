Bike Sales Dashboard

>Project Overview

This project analyzes a bike company's sales data to understand key factors influencing customer purchasing decisions. The final deliverable is an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of bike sales, helping stakeholders identify trends, uncover patterns, and make data-driven decisions.

>Technology Used

Microsoft Excel

>Data Sourcing & Organization

Upon obtaining the dataset in Excel format, the following three sheets were created to streamline analysis:

Working Sheet – A duplicate of the original dataset where data cleaning and transformation were performed without affecting the raw data.

Pivot Calculation Sheet – Used for creating pivot tables essential for analysis.

Dashboard Sheet – Designed to showcase visualizations and interactive filters for enhanced user experience.

>Data Cleaning & Transformation

Before analysis, the dataset underwent a thorough cleaning process:

Removal of duplicates, irrelevant columns, and unwanted cells.

Standardization of values using the FIND and REPLACE functions (e.g., replacing 'M' with 'Married' in the "Marital Status" column, 'F' with 'Female' in the "Gender" column, etc.).

Conversion of the "Income" column to currency format.

Creation of age brackets using a nested IF function to categorize customers into three age groups.

>Data Analysis

To uncover insights, five pivot tables were created, examining the relationship between bike purchases and factors such as:

Average Income

Commute Distance

Profession

Home Ownership

Age Group

>Data Visualization

The final dashboard was built using customized pivot charts, allowing users to explore trends interactively. To enhance usability, three slicers were incorporated for dynamic filtering.

>Key Insights

Analysis of the data revealed the following trends:

Customers with higher average income in their respective categories were more likely to purchase bikes.

The majority of bike purchases came from individuals aged 31-54, categorizing them as the primary target audience.

Short-distance commuters (0-1 mile) had the highest likelihood of buying a bike, followed by those commuting 2-5 miles.

Individuals with a commute distance exceeding 5 miles were less inclined to purchase a bike.

Homeowners showed a greater propensity for bike purchases compared to renters.

Professionals constituted the largest segment of bike buyers.

>Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following strategic recommendations can help improve bike sales:

Target the Middle-Aged Segment (31-54 years) – Since this age group demonstrates the highest purchase rate, marketing efforts should prioritize this demographic.

Focus on Short-Distance Commuters – With an inverse relationship between commute distance and bike purchases, marketing campaigns should highlight the benefits of biking for short commutes.

Engage Homeowners – As homeowners are more responsive to promotional offers and discounts, special deals should be tailored to attract this customer base.
